<LegalLayout title="Terms of Service" lastUpdated="February 2026" canonicalPath="/terms/" description="Terms of Service for Caipi. Usage terms, requirements, and policies for our free and open-source software.">
  <section>
    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By downloading or using Caipi ("the Software"), you agree to be bound by these
      Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms do not limit any mandatory consumer protection rights you may have under applicable
      law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Open Source License</h2>
    <p>
      Caipi is free and open-source software. The source code is available on GitHub and subject to
      the terms of its open-source license. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the Software
      in accordance with that license.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Caipi requires Claude Code CLI (version 2.0 or higher) and an active Claude subscription or
      API access from Anthropic. Caipi communicates with Claude Code through its official command-line
      interface—all AI requests are processed by and through the Claude Code CLI installed on your
      system. Caipi does not access Anthropic's APIs directly or modify Claude Code's authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claude Code is provided by Anthropic and subject to their terms of service. We are not
      affiliated with Anthropic and cannot guarantee the availability or functionality of their
      services. Your use of Claude Code through Caipi remains subject to Anthropic's terms, and
      you are responsible for ensuring your usage complies with those terms.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, the Software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
      We do not warrant that the Software will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific
      requirements. Use of the Software is at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caipi interacts with your local file system and can execute commands on your computer.
      While we implement permission controls, you are responsible for reviewing and approving
      actions taken by the Software.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
      special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data,
      business interruption, or loss of profits, arising from your use of the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under
      applicable law (for example, for intent, gross negligence, or injury to life, body, or health).
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Updates and Changes</h2>
