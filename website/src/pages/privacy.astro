    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Update Checks</h3>
    <p>
      Caipi periodically checks for updates (for example via GitHub Releases). This sends a request
      containing your current version number. Like any web request, the services involved may also
      receive technical data such as your IP address and user agent, which is used only for basic
      security and troubleshooting.
